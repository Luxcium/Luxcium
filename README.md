# SOLID principles

Although they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can 
also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as [agile development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) or 
adaptive software development.

## Concepts



- [Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
 - [Open–closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
 - [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.See also design by contract.
 - [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
 - [Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

### History

The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by 
[Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) (Uncle Bob)
in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns. The SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.

# Design Patterns

**Design Patterns:** *Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)* is a software engineering book describing software design patterns. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, with a foreword by Grady Booch.

It has been influential to the field of software engineering and is regarded as an important source for object-oriented design theory and practice. The authors are often referred to as the Gang of Four «GoF».

## Creational

**Creational patterns are ones that create objects, rather than having to
instantiate objects directly. This gives the program more flexibility in
deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.**

 - 01. [Abstract factory ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) groups object factories that have a common theme.
 - 02. [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) constructs complex objects by separating construction and
       representation.
 - 03. [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) creates objects without specifying the exact class
       to create.
 - 04. [Prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern) creates objects by cloning an existing object.
 - 05. [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

## Structural

**These concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose
interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.**

 - 06. [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by
      wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
 - 07. [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
       can vary independently.
 - 08. [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be
       manipulated as one object.
 - 09. [Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of
       an object.
 - 10. [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
 - 11. [Flyweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern) reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number
       of similar objects.
 - 12. [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern) provides a placeholder for another object to control access,
       reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

## Behavioral

**Most of these design patterns are specifically concerned with communication
between objects.**

 - 13. [Chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) delegates commands to a chain of processing
       objects.
 - 14. [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
 - 15. [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern) implements a specialized language.
 - 16. [Iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) accesses the elements of an object sequentially without
       exposing its underlying representation.
 - 17. [Mediator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern) allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class
       that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
 - 18. [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern) provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state
       (undo).
 - 19. [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of
       observer objects to see an event.
 - 20. [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal
       state changes.
 - 21. [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected
       on-the-fly at runtime.
 - 22. [Template method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern) defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract
       class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
 - 23. [Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving
       the hierarchy of methods into one object.
